# SpaceBunnies
Game 2 for ICS 161 (Game Lab)

Description: A scifi 2D platformer where the player plays as a robot. The goal is escape from the 
space station by jumping from platform to platform while avoiding or killing the nefarious space bunnies.
You win if you unlock and reach the door at the end of level 3. There is no loss state: if the player 
loses all health, the level simply resets or the player respawns at a checkpoint. 

The game should be very challenging for players, but should not be punishing. Players should feel stress 
while platforming and shooting bunnies and then feel relief when the goal is reached and the level is 
over. The mechanics should be straightforward and not confusing to players. 

Any resources used (sprites, sound effects, etc.) were found through Google and the Unity Asset Store.

Builds can be found in Assets/Builds. final.zip contains the final build.
